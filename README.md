#### Trybe Studies

This repository is dedicated to all my works, exercises and projects while studying in Trybe.

During my one year time with this excellent programing school, I was able to develop a whole different kind of projects and exercises that are all in this repository since day one. I pretty much did every single proposed exercise on a daily basis and all my projects, the way Trybe rate you, were done with a 100% of all requirements working and passing the evaluator.

Feel free to look and contact me in case of any doutb
